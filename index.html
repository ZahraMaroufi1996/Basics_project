                Ultraviolet (UV)
            </strong>

            Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a form of non-ionizing radiation that is emitted by the sun and artificial sources, such as tanning beds. 
            While it has some benefits for people, including the creation of Vitamin D, it also can cause health risks.
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li> Our natural source of UV radiation:
                <ul><li>The sun</li></ul>
            </li>
      
            <li> Some artificial sources of UV radiation include: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Tanning beds</li>
                    <li>Mercury vapor lighting (often found in stadiums and school gyms)</li>
                    <li> Some halogen, fluorescent, and incandescent lights </li>
                    <li> Some types of lasers </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        <h2>
            Types of UV Radiation Rays
        </h2>

        <p>
            UV radiation is classified into three primary types:
            <em> ultraviolet A (UVA) </em> 
            ,<em> ultraviolet B (UVB)</em> 
            <em> and ultraviolet C (UVC) </em> 
            , based on their wavelengths. Almost all the UV radiation that reaches earth is UVA though some UVB radiation reaches earth.
            UVA and UVB radiation can both affect health, but UVA penetrates deeper into the skin and is more constant throughout the year
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3> Benefits </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The production of vitamin D, a vitamin essential to human health</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus from food and assists bone development. 
            The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 5 to 15 minutes of sun exposure 2 to 3 times a week
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3> Risks </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sunburn is a sign of short-term overexposure, while premature aging and skin cancer are side effects of prolonged UV exposure</li>
            <li>UV exposure increases the risk of potentially blinding eye diseases if eye protection is not used</li>
            <li>Overexposure to UV radiation can lead to serious health issues, including cancer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. The two most common types of skin cancer are basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer.
            Typically, they form on the head, face, neck, hands, and arms because these body parts are the most exposed to UV radiation.
            Most cases of melanoma, the deadliest kind of skin cancer, are caused by exposure to UV radiation
